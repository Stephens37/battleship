The player module was intended to be used as a module to render the player and computer gameboards.
Currently, however, there are two functions:

- one for telling the player to choose another spot of attack if a square that was already clicked on was tapped on
- another to randomly generate the computer's choice of square

Obviously neither of these fit in this module.
They would fit better in the gameboard module as that module is meant for controlling the gameflow.

The code located in the display.js module is a lot more fitting to be considered the player module.
This is because it renders the player and computer boards, thus fulfilling the purpose of the player module.

Changes to the player.js module and display.js module:

- display.js becomes player.js

- the contents of squareChosen() will be attached to receiveAttack() in the gameboard module
- the computerChoice() function will be moved to the gameboard object
- the tests used for these functions will be moved to gameboard.test.js and played out before proceeding with further developments
