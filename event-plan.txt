how do I make a square clickable if:
- I don't want to call the gameboard function because that would create an interwoven dependency
- the square has only a class
- I want to access the coordinates of the square I am clicking but to access it through a class would create errors
- javascript recommends that I do not create template literal ids


I could:
- create the event listener in the the index file
- have it select the square class
- have it find the coordinates of the square that was clicked with said class (main challenge !!!)

- how to find the 

- call the placement function with said coordinates
- within the placement function add code that changes the color of the selected squares to green

- that then begs the question: "how do I change the colors of each square by their coordinates?"
- is there a way to select the coordinates from the array not by its place in the array but by the value itself?

But then that would mean that i wouldn't be able to use a loop for the function

What I could do instead:
- keep the rest of the function
- add a "s" variable outside the function
- s goes up by 1 each time
