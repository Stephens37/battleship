- shiptype chosen
- when square is clicked trigger placement function

- the issue is that I want to loop over the ship types but I dont want to continue the loop
- I want the loop to continue after the event listener and subsequent ship placement is fulfilled

- shiptype is identified at the beginning of the placement function
* shipType = shipArr[i] where i = 0
- if the placement function fulfills the placement of the ship then i++
